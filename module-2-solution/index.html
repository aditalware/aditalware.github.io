                         Red blood cells: The blood cells that carry oxygen. Red cells contain hemoglobin and it is the hemoglobin which permits them to transport oxygen (and carbon dioxide). Hemoglobin, aside from being a transport molecule, is a pigment. It gives the cells their red color (and their name).

                       White blood cells are made in the bone marrow. They are stored in your blood and lymph tissues. Because some white blood cells have a short life of 1 to 3 days, your bone marrow is always making them.Your white blood cells account for only about 1% of your blood, but their impact is big.

                        Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. If one of your blood vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals to the platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of damage. they form a plug (clot) to fix the damage.
